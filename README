This playbook can be used to apply basic security strengthening to an RHV environement by applying changes to RHVH hosts.

This was verified in RHV 4.3

Onen the inventory file and add the IP/IPs of the hosts which need to have the fixes.

Use the below command to execute the plybook

ansible-playbook -i inventory apply_basic_security.yaml --user=root -k -K

Note: The --user option can be  updated to a prefered non root user which has sudo privileges.
	The playbok was only verified using root user. Manually enter the password for root user for each host when prompted.

The following fixes will be applied when using this simple playbook.

1. Update the sshd configurations to use strong ciphers and hash macs
2. Update VDSM configurations to use strong hash algorithms and restrict of sing older TLS versions.
3. Updating spice confs to use storng hashing algorithms
4. Stop cockpit service to close the port of an unused service. (If cockpit service is being used, this is not needed.)
